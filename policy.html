  <br>  This will serve as THE main policy. #2 will be shadow ruler. All numbers after are alts.
  <br>  0. Divine Steel Will: 7promise&pledge to not die when jumping off cliff
  <br>  5142 WILL follow these policies.
  <br>  Policies.
  <br>  They should be followed. Otherwise, there would be no point in them.
  <br>  If a component fails, then the entire number must be redressed.
  <br>  This does not mean total annihilation. That would be effort wasted.
  <br>  Each policy applies to other policies to ensure information is displayed neatly and tidily.
    <br>
  <br>  All policy number(s), denoted by #, will be in the "All Policies" folder with policy.html master page and 2019's NYR.
  <br>  Policy numbers will be distributed to their respective addresses.
  <br>  Every policy number will be about me, not outsiders. For example, sponsors.
  <br>  Designed for strictly offline access.
    <br>
  <br>  TN: The date is the day when the policy number was implemented. Version numbers will not be recorded.
